The primary objective of this project is to analyze the provided health and fitness dataset
to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and generate actionable recommendations. The
project aims to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and health conditions
like hypertension and diabetes, identifying critical BMI thresholds that indicate higher risks. It also
seeks to examine how fitness goals vary across different demographics, such as age, gender, and
health conditions, to highlight common objectives for various groups. Furthermore, the project
explores the types and frequencies of exercises recommended or followed, identifying popular
activities and their alignment with specific goals or health conditions.

Analyze dietary habits, including vegetable intake, protein consumption, and juice preferences, to understand their relationship with 
fitness goals, BMI levels, and health conditions like hypertension and diabetes.

Identify how specific dietary patterns contribute to achieving particular fitness goals or managing health risks.
